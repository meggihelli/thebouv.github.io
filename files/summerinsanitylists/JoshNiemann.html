                    <span class="bold">And They Shall Know no Fear:</span>
                     A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule automatically passes Fear and Regroup tests. When it Regroups, the unit does not make the 3" Regroup move, but can instead move, shoot (or Run) and declare charges normally in that turn. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Furthermore, if a unit containing one or more models with this special rule is caught by a Sweeping Advance, they are not destroyed, but remain locked in combat instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Chapter Tactics *</span>

                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Combat Squads:</span>
                     A full strength, ten-man unit with this special rule can break down into two five-man units, called combat squads, considered to be two five-man squads of the same type. For example, a ten-man Tactical Squad can split into two five-man Tactical Squads using the Combat Squads special rule.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    You must decide which units are splitting into combat squads, and which models go into each combat squad, immediately before determining your Warlord Traits. A unit split into combat squads therefore is now two separate units for all game purposes, including calculating the total number of units in the army and determining the number of units you can place in reserve. Then proceed with deployment as normal. In an exception to the normal rules, two combat squads split from the same unit can embark in the same transport vehicle, providing its Transport Capacity allows. Once you have decided whether or not to split a unit into combat squads, it must remain that way for the entire battle. It cannot split up or join back together later on in the battle, nor can you use a redeployment to split up a unit or join it back together.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Note that Bike Squads count as being at full strength when they have eight Space Marine Bikers and one Attack Bike. If split into combat squads, one combat squad will have five Bikers, the other will have three and the Attack Bike.

                    <span class="bold">Feel No Pain:</span>
                     When a model with this special rule suffers an unsaved Wound, it can make a special Feel No Pain roll to avoid being wounded (this is not a saving throw and so can be used against attacks that state that ‘no saves of any kind are allowed’, for example those inflicted by Perils of the Warp).<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Feel No Pain saves may not be taken against Destroyer attacks or against unsaved Wounds that have the Instant Death special rule.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Roll a D6 each time an unsaved Wound is suffered. On a 4 or less, you must take the Wound as normal. On a 5+, the unsaved  Wound is discounted – treat it as having been saved.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    If a unit has the Feel No Pain special rule with a number in brackets afterwards –Feel No Pain (6+), for example – then the number in brackets is the D6 result needed to discount the Wound.

                    <span class="bold">Independant Character:</span>
                     Independent Characters can join other units. They cannot, however, join units that contain vehicles or Monstrous Creatures. They can join other Independent Characters, though, to form a powerful multi-character unit!<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Joining and Leaving a Unit<br/>
                    An Independent Character can begin the game already with a unit, either by being deployed in unit coherency with it or, if the unit is in Reserve, by you informing your opponent of which unit it has joined.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    In order to join a unit, an Independent Character simply has to move so that he is within the 2" unit coherency distance of a friendly unit at the end of their Movement phase. If the Independent Character is within 2" of more than one unit at the end of its Movement phase, the player must declare which unit it is joining. If an Independent Character does not intend to (or cannot) join a unit, it must (where possible) remain more than 2" away from it at the end of the Movement phase. This is to make clear whether they have joined a unit or not. Note that, after an Independent Character joins a unit, that unit can move no further that Movement phase.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    An Independent Character can leave a unit during the Movement phase by moving out of unit coherency with it. He cannot join or leave during any other phase – once shots are fired or charges are declared, it is too late to join in or duck out!<br/>
                    <br/>
                    An Independent Character cannot leave a unit while either he or the unit is in Reserves, locked in combat, Falling Back or has Gone to Ground. He cannot join a unit that is in Reserves, locked in combat or Falling Back. If an Independent Character joins a unit, and all other models in that unit are killed, he again becomes a unit of one model at the start of the following phase.<br/>
                    While an Independent Character is part of a unit, he counts as part of the unit for all rules purposes, though he still follows the rules for characters.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Look Out, Sir<br/>
                    Independent Characters pass Look Out, Sir rolls on a 2+.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Heroic Morale<br/>
                    A unit that contains one or more Independent Characters does not need a double 1 to Regroup if reduced to below 25% of its starting numbers, but instead tests as if it had at least 25% remaining.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Special Rules<br/>
                    When an Independent Character joins a unit, it might have different special rules from those of the unit. Unless specified in the rule itself (as in the Stubborn special rule), the unit’s special rules are not conferred upon the Independent Character, and the Independent Character’s special rules are not conferred upon the unit. Special rules that are conferred to the unit only apply for as long as the Independent Character is with them.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Independent Characters and Infiltrate<br/>
                    An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Independent Characters and Ongoing Effects<br/>
                    Sometimes, a unit that an Independent Character has joined will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect, such as those bestowed by the Blind special rule, for example. If the character leaves the unit, both he and the unit continue to be affected by the effect, so you’ll need to mark the character accordingly.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    For example, Farseer Mehiledrin and his unit of Eldar Guardians are set ablaze by a weapon with the Soul Blaze special rule. If Mehiledrin leaves the unit, both he and the Guardians will still be ablaze and the ongoing effects of the Soul Blaze rule must be resolved separately.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Conversely, if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after himself having been the target of an ongoing effect) benefits and penalties from that effect are not shared.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    For example, Crimson Fists Tactical Squad Hemanez is suffering the effects of the Blind special rule. If Captain Cruiz joins the unit, he does not suffer the results of the Blind special rule as he was not there when it happened!

                     At the end of each of your turns, roll a D6 for each of your models with this special rule that has less than its starting number of Wounds or Hull Points, but has not been removed as a casualty or destroyed. On a roll of 5+, that model regains a Wound, or Hull Point, lost earlier in the game.

                    <span class="bold">Move Through Cover:</span>
                     A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule rolls an extra D6 when rolling to move through difficult terrain and is not slowed by charging through difficult terrain. In most circumstances, this will mean that, when moving, the unit rolls 3D6 and picks the highest roll. Furthermore, a model with the Move Through Cover special rule automatically passes Dangerous Terrain tests.

                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Scout:</span>
                     After both sides have deployed (including Infiltrators), but before the first player begins his first turn, a unit containing at least one model with this special rule can choose to redeploy. If the unit is Infantry, Artillery, a Walker or a Monstrous Creature, each model can redeploy anywhere entirely within 6" of its current position. If it is any other unit type, each model can instead redeploy anywhere entirely within 12" of its current position. During this redeployment, Scouts can move outside the owning player’s deployment zone, but must remain more than 12" away from any enemy unit. A unit that makes a Scout redeployment cannot charge in the first game turn. A unit cannot embark or disembark as part of a Scout redeployment.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    If both sides have Scouts, roll-off; the winner decides who redeploys first. Then alternate redeploying Scout units.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    If a unit with this special rule is deployed inside a Dedicated Transport, it confers the Scout special rule to the Transport (though a disembarkation cannot be performed as part of the redeployment). Note that a Transport with this special rule does not lose it if a unit without this special rule is embarked upon it. Having Scout also confers the Outflank special rule to units of Scouts that are kept as Reserves.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Outflank<br/>
                    During deployment, players can declare that any unit that contains at least one model with this special rule is attempting to Outflank the enemy. When this unit arrives from Reserves, but not Ongoing Reserve, the controlling player rolls a D6: on a 1-2, the unit comes in from the table edge to the left of their controlling player’s own table edge; on a 3-4, they come on from the right; on a 5-6, the player can choose left or right. Models move onto the table as described for other Reserves. If a unit with Scouts is deployed inside a Dedicated Transport, they may Outflank along with their Transport.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Iinfiltrate and Scout<br/>
                    If a unit has both the Infiltrate and Scout special rule, that unit can deploy as per the Infiltrate special rule and then redeploy as per the Scout special rule.

                     Non-vehicle Iron Hands models have the Feel No Pain (6+) special Rule. If they have the Feel No Pain rule from another source (a narthecium, for example), they instead add 1 to the result of any Feel No Pain rolls.

                    <span class="bold">Zealot:</span>
                     A unit containing one or more models with the Zealot special rule automatically passes Pinning, Fear and Regroup tests and Morale checks, but cannot Go to Ground and cannot choose to fail a Morale check due to the Our Weapons Are Useless rule. If a unit gains the Zealot special rule when it has Gone to Ground, all the effects of Go to Ground are immediately cancelled.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    In addition, units containing one or more models with the Zealot special rule re-roll all failed To Hit rolls during the first round of each close combat – they do not get to re-roll failed To Hit rolls in subsequent rounds.
